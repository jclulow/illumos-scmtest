DESCRIPTION
===========
This test suite is designed to test the functionality of the scm tools.


CTI-TET PACKAGE INSTALLATION
============================
As root do the following:

In the majority of cases, the test suite can be installed from packages. The
package is called SUNWstc-tetlite and installs into "/opt" by default. 
Installation is via the standard Solaris package installation tool pkgadd(1m). 
To install SUNWstc-tetlite simply enter the following command line:

# pkgadd -d <package location>  SUNWstc-tetlite

Where <package location> refers to the path containing the SUNWstc-tetlite
package directory.

o It is recommended that you install the packages from scratch,
rather than on top of an existing installation.  Thus, if an old
version of the tests is installed:

# pkgrm SUNWstc-tetlite


TEST SUITE INSTALLATION
=======================
As root do the following:

In the majority of cases, the test suite can be installed from packages. The
package is called SUNWstc-scm and installs into "/opt" by default. 
Installation is via the standard Solaris package installation tool pkgadd(1m). 
To install SUNWstc-scm simply enter the following command line:

# pkgadd -d <package location>  SUNWstc-scm

Where <package location> refers to the path containing the SUNWstc-scm
package directory.

o It is recommended that you install the packages from scratch,
rather than on top of an existing installation.  Thus, if an old
version of the tests is installed:

# pkgrm SUNWstc-scm

BUILDING THE TEST SUITE
=======================
The test suite source can also be installed locally, built in the source
tree and run from that location.

As any user do the following after installing the test suite source:
1. TET_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite
2. export TET_ROOT
3. CTI_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib/ctitools
4. export CTI_ROOT
5. TET_SUITE_ROOT=<source tree> (ie. /opt/test/scmtest/src/suites)
6. export TET_SUITE_ROOT
7. cd $TET_SUITE_ROOT/scm
8. /usr/ccs/bin/make


TEST SUITE CONFIGURATION
========================
As root do the following steps:

1. Set the following environment variables
	export TET_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite
	export CTI_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib/ctitools
	export TET_SUITE_ROOT=<path of suite> (ie. /opt/SUNWstc-scm)
	PATH=$PATH:$CTI_ROOT/bin
	export PATH

2. To configure the test suite:

# run_test scm configure


TEST SUITE EXECUTION
====================
You may run the test suites as any user.

If not already done, from the configuration phase do the following to 
set the environment variables :

	export TET_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite
	export CTI_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib/ctitools
	export TET_SUITE_ROOT=<path of suite> (ie. /opt/SUNWstc-scm)
	PATH=$PATH:$CTI_ROOT/bin
	export PATH

To run the entire test suite do the following.

# run_test scm

To execute individual scenarios (example)

# run_test scm <scenario>

# run_test scm example

To execute Test Purposes within a scenario :

run_test scm tools/<test case dir>:<test purpose number>

# run_test scm tools/example:1


TEST SUITE UNCONFIGURE
======================
The unconfiguration of the test suite simply takes out the configuration file
for the current host, so that an nfs mounted point for execution can be used.

# run_test scm unconfigure
